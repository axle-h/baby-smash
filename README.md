TODO
* 2 player duplicate controls
* redo create sounds (my/esme's voice?)
* shuffle between 3-4 bg particle displays
* Characters
  * Pac-Man:
    * should actively chase assets
    * should go in opposite direction on collision with another pan man
    * should set impulse with terminal velocity rather than set velocity so it can be affected by explosion
  * Solar Jetman
    * sounds: nothing available so need to extract via emulation for which a cheat is required to disable the music
